### Project Overview
---
My goal for this project is to gain proficiency in data analysis through structured learning journey, encompassing data collection, and visualization. By the end of this journey, I will have the skills to work with various data sets, extract insights, and communicate findings effectively. By extension, analysing the various paramenters in the data recieved to make reasonable decision which then enable us to tell compelling stories around our data from the insight gotten and to know the best performace from our data.

### Exploratory Data Analysis
---
EDA Involves the exploring of Data to answer some questions about the Data suche as;
