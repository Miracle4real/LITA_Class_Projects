### Project Overview
---
My goal for this project is to gain proficiency in data analysis through structured learning journey, encompassing data collection, and visualization. By the end of this journey, I will have the skills to work with various data sets, extract insights, and communicate findings effectively. By extension, analysing the various paramenters in the data recieved to make reasonable decision which then enable us to tell compelling stories around our data from the insight gotten and to know the best performace from our data. 

### Key Learning Stages:- 
---
### 1. Foundational Stage:
Understanding Data Analysis
- Topics Covered: 
  - Introducing Data Analysis and its importance: Data Analysis is the compass that guides decision makers through a sea of information. It enables organizations based their choices on concrete evidence rather than intuition or guess work. It provide a deeper understanding of processes, behavious and trends. By analyzing data, decision-makers can assess various options, potential risks and rewards, leading to better choices.
    Informed Decision-Making 
     1. Improved Understanding
     2. Competitive Advantage
     3. Informed Decision-Making
     4. Risk Mitigation
     5. Efficient Resource Allocation
     6. Continous Improvement 
### 2. Data Collection and Cleaning: 
---
#### Building the Basics: 
- Topics Covered:
  1. Data Collection Methods (APIs, web scraping, surveys).
  2. Data Cleaning Techniques (handling missing data, dealing with outliers).
  3. Introduction to libratries like Excel, SQL and Power BI.
- Outcome:
  1. Ability to gather raw data and prepare it for analysis.
  2. experence in cleaning and organizing datasets.
- Practice:
  1. Clean a simple dataset with common data issues (e.g., mising values, duplicate values, e.t.c.)
### 3. Data Exploration: Getting to know your Data
- Topics covered:
  1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques.
  2. Descriptive statistics.
  3. Data visualization basics (histograms, scatter plots, bar charts and more).
- Outcomes:
  1. proficiency in using EDA to identify patterns and insights.
  2. Ability to create meaningful visualization.
### Working with Large Datasets
- Topics covered:
  - Microsoft Excel: a powerful tool for data analysis, widely used for organizing, analyzing and visualizing data. Below is an overview of how Excel can be used for Data Analysis:
    1. Data Loading and Inspection.
    2. Handling missing variables.
    3. Data Cleaning: This includes removing duplicates, handling missing data, and using functions like TRIM to remove extra spaces.
    4. Sorting and Filtering: Excel allows you to sort data in ascending and descending order and filter out unnecessary data for specific criteria.
    5. Text to Columns: This feature splits text into different columns, which is useful for separating data like full names int first and last names.
       Exaples of Basic Excel Formatting.

  - SQL for D
### Data Sources
The primary sources of Data used here is Data Sales

### Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel [Download Here](https://www.microsoft.com)
  1. for Data Cleaning
  2. For Analysis
  3. For Data Visualization
     
- SQL  -  Structured Quarry Language for Quarying of Data
- Git Hub for Portfolio Building

### Data Cleaning and Preparations
In the initial phase of the Data Cleaning and prepartions, we perform the following action;
1. Data loading and Inspection
2. Handling missing variables
3. Data Cleaning and formatting

### Exploratory Data Analysis
---
EDA Involves the exploring of Data to answer some questions about the Data suche as;
- What is overall sales trend
- which product are top sellers
- what are the products on peak sales?

### Data Analysis

---
This is where we include some basic lines of code, queries or even some of the DAX expressions used during your analysis;

```SQL
SELECT * FROM TABLE1
WHERE CONDITION = TRUE
```
