### Project Overview
---
My goal for this project is to gain proficiency in data analysis through structured learning journey, encompassing data collection, and visualization. By the end of this journey, I will have the skills to work with various data sets, extract insights, and communicate findings effectively. By extension, analysing the various paramenters in the data recieved to make reasonable decision which then enable us to tell compelling stories around our data from the insight gotten and to know the best performace from our data. 

### Key Learning Stages:- 
---
### 1. Foundational Stage:
Understanding Data Analysis
- Topics Covered: 
  - Introducing Data Analysis and its importance: Data Analysis is the compass that guides decision makers through a sea of information. It enables organizations based their choices on concrete evidence rather than intuition or guess work. It provide a deeper understanding of processes, behavious and trends. By analyzing data, decision-makers can assess various options, potential risks and rewards, leading to better choices.
    Informed Decision-Making 
     1. Improved Understanding
     2. Competitive Advantage
     3. Informed Decision-Making
     4. Risk Mitigation
     5. Efficient Resource Allocation
     6. Continous Improvement 
### 2. Data Collection and Cleaning: 
---
#### Building the Basics: 
- Topics Covered:
  1. Data Collection Methods (APIs, web scraping, surveys).
  2. Data Cleaning Techniques (handling missing data, dealing with outliers).
  3. Introduction to libratries like Excel, SQL and Power BI.
- Outcome:
  1. Ability to gather raw data and prepare it for analysis.
  2. experence in cleaning and organizing datasets.
- Practice:
  1. Clean a simple dataset with common data issues (e.g., mising values, duplicate values, e.t.c.)
### 3. Data Exploration: Getting to know your Data
- Topics covered:
  1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques.
  2. Descriptive statistics.
  3. Data visualization basics (histograms, scatter plots, bar charts and more).
- Outcomes:
  1. proficiency in using EDA to identify patterns and insights.
  2. Ability to create meaningful visualization.
### Working with Large Datasets
- **Topics covered:**
  - **Microsoft Excel** [Download Here](https://www.microsoft.com): is a powerful tool for data analysis, widely used for organizing, analyzing and visualizing data. Below is an overview of how Excel can be used for Data Analysis:
    1. Data Loading and Inspection.
    2. Handling missing variables.
    3. Data Cleaning: This includes removing duplicates, handling missing data, and using functions like TRIM to remove extra spaces.
    4. Sorting and Filtering: Excel allows you to sort data in ascending and descending order and filter out unnecessary data for specific criteria.
    5. Text to Columns: This feature splits text into different columns, which is useful for separating data like full names int first and last names.

  - **SQL for Data Analysis:**
    SQL Stands for Structured Query Language. It is used for storing and managing data in Relational Database Management System (RDBMS). It was noted that all the RDBMS like MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, MS Access, and SQL Server use SQL as their standard database language. SQL allows users to query the database in a number of ways, using English-like statements.
    SQL follows the below rules:
    1. SQL is not case sensitive.
    2. SQL depends on relational algebra.
    3. Statement of SQL are dependent on text lines.
    4. SQL statements allows you to perform most of the actions in a database.
  - **Some Advantages of SQL are:**
    1. Data integrity
    2. Security
    3. Backup and Recovery
    4. Efficiency Data Management etc. Consistent columns types are one of the main reasons working with databases is fast.
  - **Basic SQL Commands:** SQL commands are instructions, it is used to communicate with the database. it performs specific tasks, functions, and queries of data. SQL can perform various tasks like **Create a table,** **add data to table,** **drop the table,** **modify the table,** **set permistions for users.**
  - **Types of SQL Commands:**
    1. DQL: Data Query Language - This used to fetch data from database and it uses only one command. 
    2. TCL: Transaction Control Language
    3. DCL: Data Control Language
    4. DDL: Data Defination Language
    5. DML: Data Manipulation Language
    ![SQL Command Types](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/19a23381-be8c-48bd-aec9-14a187bd512e)
  - **SQL KEYS:** Key are special fields in a table that help:
    - Create relationships between tables,
    - Maintain uniqueness, and
    - Ensure data is consistent and valid.
  - **Database Keys**
    - Primary Key: This key uniquely identifies each record in a table. It was a point to note that "Each table can have only one primary key".
    - Foreign Key: This key uniquely identifies a row of another table, creating a relationship between the two table.
    - Sorrogate Key: This is a unique identifier for each record in a table created by the database itself.
    - Composite Key is a group of two or more columns that identifies each row of a table uniquely.
    - Candidate Key is a key of a table which can be selected as primary key.
    - Alternate Key is a candidate key, currently not selected as a primary key of the table.
      
  - **SQL Aggregate Functions:** SQL aggregate functions are powerful tools used to perform calculations on a set of values, returning a single balue that summarizes the data. 
    ![SQL Aggregation Function](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/db1f802c-c509-4d8b-873b-7ff203f6140e)
  - **SQL Joins:** SQL Joins has to do with combining two or more tables.
    ![SQL Joins](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3451ed4f-d636-40b1-974e-754a34e81454)
  - **SQL Set Operation:** This allows you to combine the result of two or more SELECT queries. This treat result sets as mathematical sets. SQL provides the following set operations:
    - Union
    - Union All
    - Intersect
   - **Power BI for Data Analysis:**
     Power BI is a buisiness analytics service developed by Microsoft that allows you to visualize and share insights from your data. It connects to a wide range of data sources and enables users to create interactive reports, dashboards, and visualizations that can be shared within an organization or embedded in apps and websites.
   - Key Components of Power BI
     1. **Power BI Destop:** This is a windows application that allows your to create reports and data visualizations.
     2. **Power BI Service:** This is an online service where you can publish, share, and collaborate on power BI reports and dashboards.
     3. **Power BI Mobile:** This is a mobile application for Android. iOS, and Windows devices, allowing you to access and interact with your data from anywhere.

### Exploratory Data Analysis
---
EDA Involves the exploring of Data to answer some questions about the Data suche as;
- What is overall sales trend
- which product are top sellers
- what are the products on peak sales?

### Data Analysis

---
This is where we include some basic lines of code, queries or even some of the DAX expressions used during your analysis;

```SQL
SELECT * FROM TABLE1
WHERE CONDITION = TRUE
```
